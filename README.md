# Hi, I’m Muhammad Sami Ullah 👋

### Supply Chain & Operations Data Analyst

I work at the intersection of logistics, data, and money.

My focus is simple.  
Find where supply chains fail, quantify the financial impact, and turn operational chaos into clear decisions.

I specialize in e-commerce operations, where delivery delays, seller complexity, and poor forecasting quietly erode revenue and customer trust.

### What I’m Working On
- Revenue-at-risk diagnostics for large e-commerce datasets  
- Root-cause analysis of delivery delays and logistics bottlenecks  
- Building predictive models to flag operational failures before they happen  

---

### What I’m Learning Next
- Time-series forecasting for demand and delivery risk  
- Inventory and fulfillment optimization using historical patterns  

---

### How I Work
I don’t treat late deliveries as a customer service issue.  
I treat them as a financial problem.

Every delay has a cost.  
My job is to make that cost visible.
